******************
*  OpenMPT 1.23  *
******************


Installation
------------

-If you have an existing *portable* installation of OpenMPT and wish to re-use
 its settings, copy your mptrack.ini and plugin.cache to the directory into
 which you extract the archive.
-If there is no previous installation or if you have an existing *standard*
 installation of OpenMPT, you're done: just extract the archive and launch
 mptrack.exe.


Uninstallation
--------------

-Delete the files extracted from the archive and optionally the OpenMPT
 setting files, which are by default stored in %APPDATA%\OpenMPT.


Making OpenMPT portable
-----------------------

By default, OpenMPT stores its settings in %APPDATA%\OpenMPT. To avoid this,
create a file called "mptrack.ini" in the same directory as mptrack.exe (if
it does not exist yet) and add the following lines to this file:
[Paths]
UseAppDataDirectory=0

Alternatively, you can copy your existing configuration file over from
%APPDATA%\OpenMPT and add UseAppDataDirectory=0 in the [Paths] section of this
file.
