 - Portaudio version svn-r1910 as of 2013-09-07.
 - A small modification to portaudio code has been made in src/hostapi/wdmks/pa_win_wdmks.c
   to facilitate linking against strmiids.lib . Look for "OpenMPT" there.
 - Portaudio can freeze on Windows XP when intializing Kernel Streaming and the sound setup
   topology doesn't meet some assumptions Portaudio seems to make. There is no official fix
   for this yet, but a fix has been posted on the Audacity mailing list
   (http://sourceforge.net/p/audacity/mailman/message/31421748/). Modifications
   have been applied to src/hostapi/wdmks/pa_win_wdmks.c to fix this problem,
   look for the LASSESB_GCP_LOOP_DETECTION.
 - For building, premake4 is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
   See ../premake4.lua for details.

   NOTE: Various versions of the Windows SDK (such as the one provided with the VS2008 x64 compiler) 
   do not provide ksguid.lib. To simplify the build configuration, PA_WDMKS_NO_KSGUID_LIB
   is defined in the premake projects to always use PortAudio's workaround, regardless of
   the compiler version used.
